# Indian-startup-Funding-Analysis

This project analyzes a startup funding dataset to uncover insights about funding trends, top sectors, leading cities, popular startups, and key investors. It also visualizes the results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## üìÇ Dataset

The script expects a CSV file named `startup_funding.csv` located at:

```

```

### Example Columns:

* `Amount in USD`
* `Investors Name`

* **Data Cleaning:**

  * Standardizes date formats.
  * Removes null values for essential fields.
  * Cleans and formats text columns.
  * Corrects typos in column names.

```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Place your `startup_funding.csv` file in `/content/` (or update the script path).
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. View printed summaries in the console and charts in separate windows.



Do you want me to also **add usage examples with sample charts** into the README so it looks more like a professional GitHub project? That would make it more appealing.
